# @flint/framework

A small back-end framework for Deno for building static sites, dynamic sites,
and APIs. Install from JSR. This is actively being developed and anything may
change at any time before 1.0.0. I'm actively working on the docs and tests, and
when those are done version 1.0.0 will be ready.
